As we can see through this analysis the most popular trees planted come grom the Acer and Prunus genera. {numref}`number_of_trees_planted_by_type`, the Number of Trees Planted by Tree Type show that the most popular trees planted are types of maple, cherry and plum trees with maple trees being the most planted in the dataset.

In {numref}`trends`: Trends in Trees Planted: 1998-2019, you will an increased trend of trees planted from 1989-2019. Maple trees seem to drive the increase as you will see a large number of the trees planted from 1991 to 2013 when there is a drop off in all tree types. There is no indication why there is a decrease in the number of maples but it may be due to a target being met. Maple trees still out plant the cherry and plum trees after 2013.

Continuing my analysis, I was curious to know where in Vancouver the trees are being planted. Using {numref}`trees_planted_by_location`, Trees Planted by Neighbourhood, it look like there healthy mix of the tree types for most areas, but as we know from the analysis so far is that the maple trees are dominant. It does look however, that there are 5 neighbourhoods that garnered most of the newly planted trees.

* Renfrew-Collingwood
* Dunbar-Southlands
* Hastings-Sunrise
* Kensington-Cedar Cottage
* Sunset

Unfortunately, there is not indication of why this is. Could it be that these area are under development, restoration or that the mix of existing trees were unbalanced?

Moving on to the height,{numref}`height` and diameter {numref}`diameter`, it looks the the majority of trees in the analysis are the height range of 10' to 40' with maple trees extending into the 80' range. As fo the diameter of the trees, they are grouped primarily around the 10" to 30" diameters with one maple in the 318" mark which could very well be a data entry error. The height and diameter ranges for the trees could be dependant on when the trees were planted. Older trees could have greater heights and diameters due to the lenght of time they have to grow while newly planted trees are very much in their infancy and haven't less time to grow.

This high level analysis of the trees was quite interesting. I think it would be interesting to understand the reasons why some trees were chosen over others. Native trees vs non-native trees would also be an intetesting analysis.
