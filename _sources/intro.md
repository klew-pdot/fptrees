# Introduction

We have looked at the Vancouver Trees in the first part of this course, Programming in Python for Data Science. It interested me to know which trees were being planted in this initiative. Some of the questions that I will cover are:

1. Which trees were the most popular to plant?
2. What are the trends in the planting of the trees?
3. Where were the trees planted?
4. What were their height?
5. What were their diameter?
