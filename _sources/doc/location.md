# Where were the trees planted?

This chart shows each of the neighbourhoods listed have a mix of all the trees planted however, there are some areas that have had many more planted than others. It is no surprise that maple trees make up the majority of trees planted with cherry and plum next in line. There is no indication on why these trees dominated, but it could because they are native to the area.
